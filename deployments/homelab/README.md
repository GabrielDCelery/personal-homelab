# Things that were set up manually

## Cloudflare API key

The Cloudflare API key was set up via `Profile` -> `API Tokens`. The various permissions can be seen here [Cloudflare API token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/)

Permissions I ended up adding:

| Permission                         | Why                                                      |
